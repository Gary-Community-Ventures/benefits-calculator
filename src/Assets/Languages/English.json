The administering government agency will determine final eligibility upon your submission of an application for each program. The information you share through the public benefits screening will be kept confidential but may be shared with a government agency and/or the third-party organization assisting you with the benefits calculator process for the sole purpose of assisting with benefits applications or offering you additional free services through Gary. Under no circumstances will your information be sold. By filling out this benefits calculator, you agree to future contact from Gary or our affiliates regarding your use of the benefits calculator or to offer additional programs that may be of interest to you and your family.
